10.2.09 Assign: For Loop Pop Art
```


- [review of for loops](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/code-programming-with-p5-js/code/4-loops/1-while-for)


In this project, you need to make interactive artwork using `for` loops. Be creative, change things like colour, size, shape, and stroke weight within the loops, and make your code interactive.

> [!TIP]
> Alternating colours
> `i % 2 === 0` checks if a number is **even**.
>
> * The `%` symbol is the **modulus**, a fancy type of division:
>
>   * **Mod** gives the **remainder** after dividing `num` by 2.
>   * If the remainder is `0`, it means the number divides evenly by 2: itâ€™s even.
>   * If the result were `1`, the number is odd.
>
> Inside of your for loop, you can add:
>   ```js
>    if (i % 2 == 0) {
>       fill("pink");   // even numbers
>    } else {
>      fill("green");  // odd numbers
>    }

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| - A single, basic for loop used without noticeable variations in visual elements. <br> - No variation in size, colour, or shape, and no visible changes in each loop. | 50%             |
| - One or more visual elements change within the loop (e.g., colour, stroke weight, transparency), but no variation across iterations. <br> - Basic variation in colour, size, shape, or transparency. <br> - Minimal interactivity or dynamic changes. | 70%             |
| - Each loop iteration involves changes in colour, stroke weight, or other visual elements, creating a dynamic and evolving pattern. <br> - Significant changes in colour, size, shape, or transparency. <br> - The artwork evolves or reacts to interactions. | 80%             |
| - loops are used to create intricate patterns, with multiple layers of variation (e.g., changing colours, shapes, or other parameters) that build complexity. <br> - Patterns are complex and visually engaging, with noticeable changes or movement in every loop iteration. <br> - Artwork responds creatively to user input, demonstrating strong interactivity. | 100%            |






## Additional Notes:
- **Creativity**: Demonstrates originality in the use of for loops to generate unique artwork.
- **Interactivity**: Code should allow user input or interaction to alter the visual output (e.g., mouse clicks, key presses, or real-time changes).
- **Manipulation of Loops**: Student shows a deep understanding of for loops, utilizing them to control various visual parameters such as shape, colour, stroke weight, and transparency in creative ways.
