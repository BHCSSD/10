10.2.07 Lesson: For Loops
```

**Things to focus on:**
* Be able to write for loops
* Be able to use for loops to draw clones




>
> Sometimes, we need to **repeat actions many times**. Instead of writing the same code over and over, we can use a **for loop**.
>
> A for loop lets us **run the same block of code multiple times**.

## Repeating shapes the anti-smart way


```javascript

let counter = 0; // Global variable

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 200);
  background(220);
}

function draw() {
  // background(220);// uncomment for fun


  let circleX = 50 +(counter*25)  
  // Draw the circle at its current position
  circle(circleX, 100, 50);

  // keep adding more circles so long as there is less than 10
  if (counter < 10) { 
    counter+= 1; // add one to the counter
  }//end if
}//end draw
```

## The better way:

> [!NOTE]
> ## INFODUMP:
> **Syntax of a For Loop**
>  * instead of calling our variable `counter` we get lazy and name it `i`
>      * `i` stands for iteration
>   ```javascript
>   for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { 
>    // code to repeat
>   }
>   ```
> 
> * `let i=0;`: start a counter variable `i` at 0
> * `i < 5;`: keep looping **while this condition is true**
> * `i++`: `i` gets bigger by 1 each time the loop runs
> * `{ ... }`: the **code block** that will repeat
> 


## **Example 1: Drawing Circles**

```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 200);
  background(220);

  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    let spacing = (i*70) //ohhh look at me im special
    circle(50 + spacing , 100, 50);
  }//end of for

}//end of set up
```

**What’s happening here?**

* `i` starts at 0, then 1, 2, 3, 4
* `let spacing = (i*70)` we want each circle to be 70 pixles apart 
* we start at 50 and the circle move **further to the right** using `50 + spacing`
    * **Check point:** how would you draw 38 circles?
    * **Check point:** how would you make them go up and down?

## **Example 2: Changing colours in a Loop**

```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 200);
  noStroke();

  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    fill(i*25, 100, 200);// ohh look at me
    let spacing = (i*40)
    rect( 10+spacing, 50, 30, 100);
  }
}
```

* Each rectangle gets a **different colour**
* `i * 25` gradually increases. 
  * The red gets redder


---

## **Why Use For Loops?**

* **Save time**: write fewer lines of code
    * part of learning to code is to make your life easier... aka lazier
* **Create patterns**: circles, grids, or repeated shapes
* **Control repetition**: adjust the number of loops by changing one number

---

## TODO:

I know copy and paste is easy, I want you to write the for loop by hand each time.

1. Use a for loop to draw **7 circles** horizontally across the canvas.
2. Make every other circle a **different colour**. see infodump

3. Make the **size of the circles increase** as you move across the canvas.
