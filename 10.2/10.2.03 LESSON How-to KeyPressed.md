10.2.03 Lesson: How-to KeyPressed
```

**Things to focus on:**
* Lean how to use th keyboard to have interactive sketches
* Lean about the `key` variable
* Learn about the **or** `||` symbol

> [!NOTE]
> ## INDODUMP:
>  **Something new: user interactions with `keyPressed()`**
> 
> In p5.js, the `keyPressed()` function runs **every time a key is pressed** on the keyboard. You can use this to check which key the user pressed and then **make your program respond** to it.
> 
> ### Basic Format:
> 
> ```javascript
> function keyPressed() {
>   if (key === "a") {
>     // Do something when the 'a' key is pressed
>   }//end of if
> }//end of keyPressed
> ```
> ---
> The `key` variable stores the **last pressed key** 
> * `key` works with letters, numbers, and symbols, 
> * For special keys like **SHIFT** or **ARROW keys**, you use `keyCode` instead.

### Whatâ€™s Happening?

* `keyPressed()` is a **built-in function**, p5.js will automatically run it whenever the user presses a key.
* You use **quotes** around letters or numbers because they are stored as **strings**.
  * This is **case-sensitive**:
  `"a"` is **not** the same as `"A"`.


```javascript
function keyPressed() {
  if (key === "s"||key=="S") { // the || means OR
    shape="square"
  } else if (key === "b"|| key === "B") {
    shape="oval"
  }//end if
}// end keypress
```

### Arrow Keys

If you want to check arrow keys, use `keyCode` instead:
```javascript
if (keyCode === LEFT_ARROW) {
  // do something
}
```

> [!TIP]
> ### Common Mistakes
>
> * Forgetting to use `===` instead of `=`.
>* Forgetting the quotation marks: `key === a` (wrong) vs. `key === "a"` (right).
>* Using it inside `draw()` (not wrong-ish... but will cause mega issues there).
