10.2.00 Lesson: If Statements
```




**Things to focus on:**
* really? you know exactly why this is here
 * learn about `if` statements
---


## What is an `if` statement?


An **if statement** is a way to tell your program:
> “If this condition is true, then do something.”


It allows your sketch to **react to conditions**, like where the mouse is or what key is pressed.


> [!NOTE]
> ### Basic Syntax
>
> ```javascript
> if(condition){
>  // code inside these curly braces runs only if condition is true
> }//end of if
> ```
>
> * `condition` is something that **evaluates to true or false**.
> * The code inside `{ }` only runs if the condition is **true**.
> * When writing these, type this first `if(){}` and go from there
>    * if you forget the  `{}` mega errors will show up


### Example:
**Change background based on mouse position**


```javascript
function setup() {
 createCanvas(400, 400);
}//end setup


function draw() {
  if (mouseX > width / 2) {
   background("lightblue"); //right side
 } else {
   background("lightpink"); //left side
 }//end of if


}//end draw
```
>   `width` is a built in variable that store how wide your canvas is


**Explanation:**


* `mouseX > width / 2` checks if the mouse is on the right half of the canvas.


 * If `true`, the background is light blue.
 * If `false`, the `else` part runs, and the background is light pink.

### Example:
**Detect a key press**


```javascript
let selectedColour = "black"


function draw() {
 background(220);


 if (keyIsDown(LEFT_ARROW)) {
   selectedColour = "red"
 } else if (keyIsDown(RIGHT_ARROW)) {
   selectedColour = "green"
 } else {
   selectedColour = "black"
 }//end of if
  fill(selectedColour)//one fill to rule them all
 circle(200, 200, 50);
}//end draw
```


**Explanation:**


* `keyIsDown(LEFT_ARROW)` checks if the left arrow key is being pressed.
* The circle changes colour depending on which key is pressed.

> [!TIP]
> *  `{ }` can be your foe
>     * from this point on you need to add a comment onto the last `}` saying `//end of if`
> * Conditions can check **numbers, mouse positions, key presses, or even boolean variables**.
>  * boolean means `true` or `false`
> * Always test your conditions to make sure they behave the way you expect.






## Checkpoint


> [!NOTE]
> ## INFODUMP:
> `num % 2 === 0` checks if a number is **even**.
> * The `%` symbol is the **modulus**, a fancy type of division:
>    * **Mod** gives the **remainder** after dividing `num` by 2.
>   * If the remainder is `0`, it means the number divides evenly by 2
>     * It's even.
>   * If the result were `1`,
>     * The number is odd.
>

```javascript
if (num % 2 === 0) {
 print("Even");
} else {
 print("Odd");
}//end of if
```


* what is printed out if:
 * `let num = 7`
 * `let num = 82`
 * `let num = 3.3`

```javascript
let someNumberGoesHere = -3


if (someNumberGoesHere > 0) {
 print("Positive")
} else if (someNumberGoesHere < 0) {
 print("Negative")
} else {
 print("Zero")// ????? Why did I put this else here?
}//end of if
```

```javascript


if (score >= 90) {
 print("A")
} else if (score >= 80) {
 print("B")
} else if (score >= 70) {
 print("C")
} else if (score >= 60) {
 print("D")
} else {
 print("F")
}//end of if
```
