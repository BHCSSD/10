# 10.3 Final Project

Create your own **mini-game** in p5js. Your game must be interactive, well-commented, and show that you understand the core coding concepts of the term.

## Marking Scheme
*Before you start coding, identify what features will move your project to the next level. Fill this out this planning doc.*

| Level | Grade Range | Criteria: What will my game include? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Level 1** | **Up to 60%** | **The Skeleton:** What are you going to do to achieve the basics? Think of this as a skeleton of a game; nothing fancy, but the basic mechanisms work. |
| **Level 2** | **Up to 80%** | **The Playable Game:** What are you adding to make this work as a game? (e.g., scoring system, power ups, or win/loss conditions). |
| **Level 3** | **Up to 90%** | **The Polished Game:** What other things are you adding? (e.g., Start/Game Over screens, refined graphics, or timers). |
| **Level 4** | **Up to 100%** | **The Pro Game:** What else is there? All the icing on the cake, what can you add to make this look good, sound good. |

## Core Coding Requirements
Your project **must include**:
1.  **At least one `if()` statement** for logic or collision.
2.  **Variables** that change (e.g., score, player position, speed).
3.  **interactivity**: At least one controller function.
4.  **Comments**: Explain *why* you used specific code blocks.

## AI Usage & The "IDK" System

### 1. The `gpt.txt` Diary
You are allowed to use GPT, but you must document it. Create a file called `gpt.txt` in your project folder. Record every prompt and what you learned:
> *Example: "I asked GPT how to make a timer. I learned about the `millis()` function."*

### 2. The IDK Rule
If you use code you don't fully understand, you must tag it in your comments:
```javascript
if (dist(x, y, mouseX, mouseY) < 20) { // IDK 1

```

* **Max 3 IDKs allowed.**
