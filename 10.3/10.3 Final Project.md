# 10.3 Final Project
```
10.3 Final Project
```
Create your own **mini game** in p5js. 
Your game must be **interactive**, **well-commented**, and show that you understand how to use:

* `if()` statements
* Variables
* At least **one controller function**:

  * `mousePressed()`
  * `mouseDragged()`
  * `mouseReleased()`
  * `keyPressed()`

---

## Requirements

### Core Coding Requirements

Your project **must include**:

1. At least one `if()` statement.
2. At least one variable that changes during the game.
3. At least one controller function for interactivity.
4. Comments explaining your all the important parts of your code:

   * Why did you use each `if()`?
   * What does each code block do?
   * Why does your code work the way it does?

### GPT Usage Rules

You are **allowed to use GPT** to help you, but you must **document everything** you ask and learn.

Create a file called **`gpt.txt`** in your p5.js project folder.
Inside, record every interaction like this:

```
I asked GPT: How do I make a bouncing ball?
GPT told me: Use velocity variables and reverse them when hitting edges.
```

Your `gpt.txt` should read like a diary, a record of your process and problem solving.

---

### The IDK System 

You are allowed **3 IDKs (I Don’t Knows)** for the entire project.

In your use of GPT you come across and use code you **don’t understand**, write a comment beside it:

```javascript
if (dist(x, y, mouseX, mouseY) < 20) { // IDK
```

If you have **more than 3 IDKs**, you must **research // learn** how one of them works before submitting

## Submission Checklist

* [ ] My game runs without errors.
* [ ] I used at least one `if()` statement.
* [ ] I used variables to store and change data.
* [ ] My game reacts to player input.
* [ ] I included clear comments beside my code.
* [ ] I made a `gpt.txt` file documenting my GPT questions and answers.
* [ ] I marked up to 3 `IDK` comments if needed.

> [!TIP]
> 
> * Make something small but polished, focus on creativity and clarity, not size.
> * Keep your code clean and organized.
> * Test your game often! Small bugs are easier to fix than big ones.

## Mouse location code. 

```js
function mousePressed(){
  print("X: ",mouseX,"Y: ",mouseY)
}
```
