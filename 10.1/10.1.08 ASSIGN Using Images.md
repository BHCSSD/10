## **Images How-To: Reminder**

See 10.1.06 for a reminder on how to do this

## **TODO 1: Find and Prepare Images**

1. Choose three characters and one background from a cartoon you like.
2. Save them to your `images` folder.
3. Use `image()` to display all four images on your canvas.
4. Adjust each image’s position and size so your scene looks balanced.

## **TODO 2: Add a Jitter Effect**

1. Pick **one** character to make “shake” or “jitter.”
2. Use `random()` to slightly change that image’s `x` and `y` values
3. This creates a “wiggle” effect — like the character had too much coffee

## **TODO 3: Written Work**

At the **top** of your code, write a short comment explaining the difference between **JPEG**, **GIF**, and **PNG** formats.
Be sure to include:

* What kind of compression each format uses (lossy or lossless), and what that means
* How many colours each format supports
* Which format is best for photos, drawings, and transparency
