**Things to focus on:**

* learn more about MVC
* Look at how to use the reference page
    * How to use `random()`
    * How to make semi transparent shapes
    * How to round corners on a `rect`




# **Common  Mistakes**

| Mistake                                   | Description / Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unclosed quotes or brackets**           | Forgetting a `"`, `(`, `[`, or `{` will break your code. Make sure every opening quote or bracket has a Sister                                                         |
| **Mis-capitalization**                    | Everything is case-sensitive. `createcanvas()` will not work, it must be `createCanvas()`. 
| **Adding 1 too many `}`**                 | Extra closing braces will create a **“Unexpected token” error**. Ensure every `{` has a matching `}`.                                                                                                                                   |
| **Removing a `}`**                        | Missing closing braces will break your code and cause errors in loops, functions, or ifs. Ask me to show you the cheat               |
| **Moving a `text()` outside of `draw()`** | `text()`, `ellipse()`, `line()` etc  should usually be inside `draw()`. Try using `print("hello")` outside of draw |

> **A Look at MVC**
> 
> MVC stands for **Model-View-Controller**, a way to organize code into three sections:
> 
> 1. **Model**: Holds the data and logic.
> 
>    * All variables and data-handling functions go here.
> 
> 2. **View**: Handles everything the user sees.
> 
>    * All drawing and display logic goes here.
> 
> 3. **Controller**: Manages user interaction and updates the model.
> 
>    * Functions for mouse clicks, key presses, etc.
>    * Can **only update variables in the Model**, no drawing.

## **Model**

The model contains variables and any logic that updates them.

```javascript
// Model
let lineY = 50;
```

---

## **View**

The view contains `setup()` and `draw()` functions for all rendering.

```javascript
// View
function setup() {
    createCanvas(600, 600);
    background(255, 255, 0); // Yellow background
} // end of setup

function draw() {
    line(0, lineY, mouseX, mouseY); // Draws a line from (50, lineY) to the mouse
    // lineY += 2; // Uncomment to make line move down automatically
} // end of draw
```

---

## **Controller**

The controller handles user interactions and updates the model.

```javascript
// Controller
function mousePressed() {
    // Empty for now - add interactivity here later
} // end of mousePressed
```
