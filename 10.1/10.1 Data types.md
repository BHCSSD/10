# 10.1 Data types

Data types tell a computer **what kind of data it’s dealing with** and what you can do with it. 
They let the program know whether it’s a number, text, true/false value, or something else. 
Choosing the right data type is important because it affects math operations, text handling, and logic decisions in your code.

Think of it like sorting your stuff: numbers go in one box, words in another, and yes/no answers in a separate box,so the computer knows how to handle each correctly.

## Data Types:
* **int (integer)**: Whole numbers without decimals. `0`, `42`, `-7`.
* **float (floating-point number)**: Numbers with decimals. `3.14`, `-0.001`, `2.0`.
* **string (str)**: Text, enclosed in quotes (single `' '` or double `" "`). `'hello'`, `"123"`.
* **boolean (bool)**: True/False values. Only two possible values: `True` or `False`.


> [!NOTE]
> * `int` and `float` are for math. Floats are used when you need precision with fractions/decimals.
> * Strings can also contain numbers, but they behave as text (so `"42" + "1"` becomes `"421"`).
> * Booleans are often used in **conditions**, like `if` statements.
