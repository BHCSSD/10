```
> [!NOTE]
> ## INFODUMP:
> **Display, Text, and Image Alignment Tools**
>
> **`textAlign()`** Controls how text is aligned relative to its x/y position.
> * Use `textAlign(CENTER,CENTER)`, `textAlign(LEFT)`, or `textAlign(RIGHT)` to position text neatly.
>
> **`imageMode()`** Controls how images are drawn on the screen.
> * `imageMode(CENTER)` makes the image draw from its center (useful for alignment).
> * `imageMode(CORNER)` is the default, which draws from the top-left.
>
> **`tint()`** Adds a colour filter or transparency to an image.
>
> ```javascript
> tint(255, 150); // semi-transparent
> image(picture, 200, 200);
> noTint(); // turn it off after
> ```
>
> **`noStroke()`** and **`noFill()`** Useful for layering shapes or creating invisible areas.
>
> **Rounded rectangles** are created with an optional corner radius:
>
> ```javascript
> rect(50, 50, 300, 500, 20); // notice the extra number
> ```
> **Fliping Images**
> ```js
> push();
>   translate(200, 200);
>   scale(-1, 1)// flip the image
>   image(bart, 0, 0, 100, 150);
> pop();
> ```


## **Assignment**
Create one of the following:
* A **sports card** or a **playing card** (e.g., actor, band, singer, etc.)
* A **game card** (like Pokémon, Magic: The Gathering, or D&D)
* An **ID card**
* A **$21 bill** for the fictional city of Atlanta…

## **Set Up**
1. Create a new P5.js file named `10.1.10 Assign: Collector Card`.
2. Use the **MVC structure** in your code with comments marking each section.
3. If you are doing a **traditional card**, set your canvas to **400 × 600**.
  For other designs, choose dimensions that fit your layout.
4. Upload your images and use descriptive variable names.

## **Marks**
### **Base Requirements: 50%**
Your card must include:
* A variable for the **name** of your person or character
 * Use the variable every time you display the name:

   ```javascript
   text(name, 50, 50);
   ```
   *Not* hard-coded like `text("James Bond", 50, 50)`
* A **background colour**
* A **rectangle** representing the card shape


 * Use **rounded corners** for a professional look
   [p5.js Reference: rect()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/rect)
* **Three pictures**


 * One main image (character or person)
 * Two others (team logo, symbol, or stat graphic)

### **Layout and Design  20%**


| Mark  | Description                                                           |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5/20  | Very little attention to alignment, size, or layout                   |
| 10/20 | Some attention to spacing and visual layout                           |
| 15/20 | Good effort, mostly aligned, some refinement needed                  |
| 20/20 | Excellent design, balanced, consistent spacing, centered text/images |


---


### **Final Features  30%**


To achieve full marks, include:


* **3 or more extra pictures**
* **One rotated item** (see [10.1.11-rotation-and-translation](#))
* **Two fonts** with at least **two text sizes**
     * Character’s name
     * Stats or powers
     * Your brand or logo
* Use multiple extra Shapes to improve visual appeal
  * rect,ellipse triangle etc.
  * These need to majorly enhance the card   


---


## **Extra Challenge -Not for marks-**


Add interactivity:


* Create a `mousePressed()` function that shows the **back** of your card while holding the mouse.
* Check the [p5.js reference for mousePressed()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/mousePressed) for help.
