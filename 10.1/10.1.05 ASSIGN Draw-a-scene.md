10.1.05 Assign: Draw-a-scene
```
> [!TIP]
>Ask me to show you how to use `push()` and `pop()` to help with colouring and formatting


**Marking Breakdown:**
* **8 points**: Drawing the scene with all required elements
* **2 points**: Code is properly indented and tidy
 * Includes helpful comments:
   * End-of-function comments: `} // end draw`
   * Descriptive comments for sections/shapes (e.g., `// snowman head`, `// bat body`)
* **1 point**: One moving item created using a variable and an `if()` statement to loop
   * Refer to **10.1.03** for a hint

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## INFODUMP Datatypes
>**Integers (int)**
> 
> * Whole numbers: … −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3 …
> * No decimal point.
> * Operations like `+`, `-`, `*`, and integer comparisons work cleanly with them.
> 
> **Floats (float)**
> 
> * Numbers **with** a decimal point: `3.14`, `0.5`, `-2.75`.
> * Used for measurements, percentages, sensor readings, and anything needing precision between whole numbers.

## **Setup**
1. Create a canvas **700 x 700** with a background colour of your choice.
2. Inside `draw()`, add **three lines of text** anywhere on the canvas.
    * Text content can be anything; the key is **three separate lines**.
    * emojis are considered a string... aka text

## **Main Task**
Draw a creative scene of your choice, or pick **one** from these suggestions:
1. A house on a street
2. An old-school iPod
3. A car, truck, or submarine
4. A snowman (must be detailed)
5. A Minecraft Creeper
6. The Stanley Cup or another trophy
7. For a challenge: a Canadian flag
8. Anything else you can imagine

## **Requirements**


Your drawing must include:


* **Background colour**
* **At least 10 shapes** you must have:
   * Lines 
   * Rectangles or squares
   * Ellipses or circles
   * Optional: triangles, quads, arcs (arcs kinda suck....)
* **Three lines of text**
* **colour variety**
    * Use `fill()` with multiple colours
    * Can use `random(0,255)` for dynamic effects
        *   dont over do it. 
* **Different stroke weights**
* **One moving element** on the screen

> [!TIP]
> * `rectMode(CENTER)`causes x,y to be center fo the rect
>     * Return to default with `rectMode(CORNER)`
> * Experiment with `noFill()` and `noStroke()` for cleaner visuals
>    * Want a more cartoon-like look? make the `strokeWeight()` bigger
> * `fill(r,g,b,A)` if you add an extra number to fill it changes the transparency  
> * Need a colour? Try this [colour picker](https://www.w3schools.com/colours/colours_picker.asp)
> * Need help with something, want to try something fancy?
>    * ask me, ask a friend, ask an enemy... all good


## **Clean Code**
* Proper indentation, descriptive comments, and organized sections will earn marks.
* Ask me what “clean code” looks like.

## **Starter Code Example**


```javascript
function setup() {
 createCanvas(300, 400);
 rectMode(CENTER); // x,y measured from center of the rect
 angleMode(DEGREES)
//textAlign(CENTER,CENTER)// measure from center fo text block
}//end of setup


function draw() {
 background(179, 89, 0);






}//end of draw


function mousePressed() {
 print(mouseX + ", " + mouseY);
} // end mousePressed
```
