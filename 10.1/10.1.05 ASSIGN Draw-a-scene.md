10.1.05 Assign: Draw-a-scene
```
> [!TIP]
>Ask me to show you how to use `push()` and `pop()` to help with colouring and formatting



**Marking Breakdown:**


* **8 points**: Drawing the scene with all required elements
* **2 points**: Code is properly indented and tidy


 * Includes helpful comments:


   * End-of-function comments: `} // end draw`
   * Descriptive comments for sections/shapes (e.g., `// snowman head`, `// bat body`)
* **1 point**: One moving item created using a variable and an `if()` statement


 * Refer to **10.1.03** for a hint


---


## **Setup**


1. Create a canvas **700 x 700** with a background colour of your choice.
2. Inside `draw()`, add **three lines of text** anywhere on the canvas.


  * Text content can be anything; the key is **three separate lines**.


---


## **Main Task**


Draw a creative scene of your choice, or pick one from these suggestions:


1. A house on a street
2. An old-school iPod
3. A car, truck, or submarine
4. A snowman (must be detailed)
5. A Minecraft Creeper
6. The Stanley Cup or another trophy
7. For a challenge: a Canadian flag
8. Anything else you can imagine






---
## **Requirements**


Your drawing must include:


* **Background colour**
* **At least 10 shapes**, including:


 * Lines
 * Rectangles or squares
 * Ellipses or circles
 * Optional: triangles, quads, arcs
* **Three lines of text**
* **colour variety**


 * Use `fill()` with multiple colours
 * Can use `random(255)` for dynamic effects
* **Different stroke weights**


 * Example: `strokeWeight(5);`
* **One moving element** on the screen
---


> [!TIP]
> * `rectMode(CENTER)` may make placement easier
> * Return to default with `rectMode(CORNER)`
> * Experiment with `noFill()` and `noStroke()` for cleaner visuals
>    * Want a more cartoon-like look? make the `strokeWeight()` bigger
> * Need a colour? Try this [colour picker](https://www.w3schools.com/colours/colours_picker.asp)
> * Need help with something, want to try something fancy?
>    * ask me, ask a friend, ask an enemy... all good


## **Clean Code**


* Proper indentation, descriptive comments, and organized sections will earn marks.
* Ask me what “clean code” looks like.

## **Starter Code Example**


```javascript
function setup() {
 createCanvas(300, 400);
 rectMode(CENTER);


}


function draw() {
 background(179, 89, 0);






}


function mousePressed() {
 print(mouseX + ", " + mouseY);
} // end mousePressed
```
