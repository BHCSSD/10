**Goal:** Learn to colour inside the lines and practice drawing basic shapes.

---

## **TODO: Part 1: Setup**

1. Make a new file named `10.1.01-Drawing-Shapes`. You can use the **copy button** at the top to get the name exactly correct.
2. Copy the **starter code** from the **bottom** of this document into the [p5.js editor](https://editor.p5js.org/). 
  * Delete all the default code from p5js, and paste in my starter code
3. Update `createCanvas(x, y)`:

   * `x = 400`
   * `y = 400`
4. Set `background()` to **any RGB colour except green**.

   * Add a comment `//` beside explaining what each number means.

---

5. Find and **uncomment** the cheat code:


    > ```js
    > // function mousePressed() {
    > //   print(mouseX + ",   " + mouseY);
    > // }
    > ```

* Remove the `//` at the start of each line to enable it.
 > [!TIP]
> Short cut to uncomment is `CTR: + /`
* When you click on the canvas this prints your mouse clicks to help find `x,y` coordinates.

## **TODO: Part 2: Draw Shapes in Each Quadrant**

6. **Quadrant 1:** Draw a **square**
7. **Quadrant 2:** Draw a **rectangle**
8. **Quadrant 3:** Draw a **circle**
9. **Quadrant 4:** Draw an **ellipse**

**You should have:**

* 1 square
* 1 rectangle
* 1 circle
* 1 ellipse
* A background colour with **no green**

---

## **TODO: Part 3: Add colour & Comments**

10. Use `fill()` to give each shape a **different colour**.
11. At the **top of your code, line 1**, press enter a few times and answer:

    >  ```js
    >  // What do stroke() and strokeWeight() do?
    > ```

* Write your answer as a comment.
* You can check the [p5.js reference](https://p5js.org/reference/) for help.

12. Beside each shape, add a comment explaining the arguments:

    > ```js
    > square(111, 111, 50); // x, y, h
    > ```

---

## **Final Check**

* File name is exactly `10.1.02 Assign: Drawing Shapes`
* Saved in the editor
* Marks will **not** be given if the name is incorrect

---

## **Starter Code**

```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(); // TODO: set 400 x 400
} // end setup- do not delete

function draw() {
  background(); 

  line(0, 200, 400, 200); // don't touch
  line(200, 0, 200, 400); // don't touch

  text("Quadrant 1", 20, 20);   // don't touch
  text("Quadrant 2", 220, 20);  // don't touch
  text("Quadrant 3", 20, 220);  // don't touch
  text("Quadrant 4", 220, 220); // don't touch


} // end draw â€“ do not delete

// function mousePressed() {
//   print(mouseX + ",   " + mouseY);
// }
```
